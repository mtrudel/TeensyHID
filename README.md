A simple breakout board for the Teensy family of microcontrollers, providing:

* 7x3 Digital / Analog IO via JST connectors. Pin selection is optimized to allow for additional functions (I2C, DAC,
  etc) to be easily accessed.
* 2 M3 mounting holes

Pairs well with breakout boards such as my [Rotary Encoder breakout board](https://github.com/mtrudel/rotary_breakout).
